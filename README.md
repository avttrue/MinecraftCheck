# MinecraftCheck

This application is designed for 

- getting information about the status of [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net) services;

- getting information about Minecraft player profiles;

- saving Minecraft player profiles to a local database (SQLITE3);

- search, filtering, and profile queries;

- generating profiles view in HTML format.

Data is accessed using the open [Mojang Api](https://wiki.vg/Mojang_API).

The [test database](https://yadi.sk/d/B8zlymoXdIkvjw) contains several thousand real player profiles. Just place this file in the directory to the application's executable file.
